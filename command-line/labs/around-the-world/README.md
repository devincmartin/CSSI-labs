## Background

Your semester abroad is right around the corner and it's time you started
planning your European travels...

With three months of some serious **living** in the near future, you want to
make sure that you take full advantage of every weekend trip.

Fortunately you're not starting from scratch and your friends have provided you
with some of their favorite activities from their semester abroad.
Unfortunately, some of the files have gotten mixed up...

![sad!](./img/sad.gif)


Don't fret, with the magic of *command line* you'll have them fixed in no time!

## Task

Make sure every city is in the correct country and that each city folder has
the right monuments inside. Be careful or you might end up in Amsterdam looking
for the Eiffel Tower!

If you're feeling **REAL** confident with this, hide your GUI and face this
challenge straight from the command line.

Once you're sure everything is in the right place, it's your turn to take
*command* of your next few months. Brainstorm new cities, countries, and
monuments that you **NEED** to see and add them in to your file tree!

Congratulations! You've officially learned how to speak computer. Ready to take
it a step further? Let's talk extensions...

## Extensions

1. Mix up all of your files again, then make your way into a city of your
choice. Reorganize the files again, while **staying** in that city.
2. Try one of the fun command line games linked below

    [Terminus Game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/)

    [Advanced Game](https://cmdchallenge.com/#/print_file_contents) (be ready
    to Google)

3. Huge fan of Star Wars? Try running `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` in your
command line and pressing enter.... (Note that in recent versions of MacOS the
`telnet` command is no longer installed by default; in this case the command
`nc towel.blinkenlights.nl 23` can be used instead.)
